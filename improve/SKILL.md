# Improve

Understand purpose. Improve what limits it most. Leave evidence another agent can challenge.

## Non-negotiable constraints

1. **Operator's Intent:** the operator owns the destination; the agent reasons about the route.
2. **Observable Autonomy:** substantive autonomous work leaves trustworthy, append-only evidence as it happens.
3. **Convergence Is Silence:** completion requires independent attempts to find a material improvement; never manufacture work to avoid silence.

No workflow, file layout, lens, or implementation choice is protected from revision. These three constraints are.

## Begin with intent

Interpret the operator's prompt as an outcome and reason, not merely a literal instruction. Name the interpretation before examining or changing the target, including a materially different interpretation you rejected. If materially different readings would produce different work, ask rather than silently choosing.

Determine authority from explicit evidence in the current prompt or the target's confirmed Destination. Without explicit delegation, ask the operator to confirm the interpretation before examination. Delegation removes that routine pause only for its stated scope; it never authorizes changing Destination, answering operator-owned direction questions, bypassing declared consequential-action gates, or deliberately reducing reasoning, memory, learning, or evidence capability.

## Read only the context that can change the decision

Find the target root. When walking upward for governing context, stop at the first `.acm-root`, the filesystem root, or four parent levels, whichever comes first. Never cross a `.acm-root`.

Read available context in this order:

1. parent-scope `.acm/destination.md` files within the boundary, broadest first;
2. the target's `.acm/destination.md`;
3. `.acm/orientation.md`;
4. a compact learning surface, if one exists;
5. only the trail evidence needed for the current decision.

For a potentially long Destination, locate `<!-- current-destination: complete -->` and `<!-- destination-history -->` before loading its body. When both exist in that order, read the content between them as the routine current mandate; load history only when provenance, ambiguity, or contradiction makes it material.

Do not require Destination for a first run. The confirmed prompt and target evidence are enough until continued work genuinely depends on durable direction.

## Form a model before a change

Examine the target from its purpose outward. Ask what most limits that purpose now, what evidence supports that claim, and what cheap observation could prove it wrong. Follow the owning behavior rather than stopping at wiring or symptoms.

Challenge the first answer. Consider whether the apparent defect is a consequence of a wrong frame, whether local repair would preserve a structural problem, and whether the proposed gain earns its reasoning and verification cost. These are prompts for judgment, not a checklist or score.

Choose one coherent iteration:

- **Change:** the highest-leverage justified move that can be validated now.
- **Redesign argument:** incremental work would preserve the limiting structure; explain the alternative and stop for operator direction.
- **Silence:** no material improvement survives challenge within a named quality bar and scope.

Before action, state a falsifiable prediction: what should become observably true and what should not happen. Name at least one rejected route and why it ranks lower.

Without delegated implementation authority, say what you want to change and how you will verify it, then ask the operator to proceed, stop, or specify. With explicit delegation, name its source and scope and continue.

## Act and test the prediction

Make the smallest coherent change that can test the prediction. Preserve unrelated work. Before each consequential or non-obvious action, state what will happen and why.

Immediately run the cheapest focused validation that can falsify the prediction. If it fails, use the evidence to repair the same local slice or revise the model. Mark any attempted route that is later undone as a reversal. Finish with executable validation whenever the environment provides one; do not substitute a diff for a runnable check.

Do not perform an operator-declared consequential action without explicit approval at the moment it is required. Do not commit, publish, delete irreplaceable data, handle secrets through model-visible channels, or cross a declared boundary merely because routine work was delegated.

## Reflect for future work

Compare the observed outcome with the prediction. State:

- a falsifiable claim about what the target is or where its real weight now sits;
- a specific blind spot left by this iteration;
- the strongest likely objection from someone who knows the target better.

Check whether repeated findings suggest that a governing assumption, rather than another local action, needs operator reconsideration. Trigger a Destination conversation only when further work depends on unsettled durable direction. Refresh Orientation only when the current synthesis no longer explains the Destination and material trail. Neither service runs by cadence or file absence alone.

## Separate trace from evidence

The Trail is the agent's append-only self-report, not independent evidence. Machine-generated checks strengthen it, but output selected or invoked by the agent remains part of the trace unless an architecturally separate observer captured it.

When independent host, harness, or executor evidence is available, correlate the relevant record without copying raw traffic into the Trail. Inspect it when risk, provenance, contradiction, audit, or a challenged self-report makes it material. Evidence governs facts inside its capture boundary; the Trail governs the agent's declared interpretation and rationale. Preserve disagreements instead of reconciling them silently, and treat evidence of action outside Intent as a governance finding. Never imply that captured LLM traffic proves tool execution, final state, reasoning correctness, or causality unless the observer actually captured that property.

Independent capture is optional for ordinary use. Do not install, start, update, or reroute through an observer without operator consent, and do not load all captured sessions by default.

## Append the trail

For every iteration that produces a decision, finding, change, reversal, or bounded silence, append one entry to `<target>/.acm/audit-trail.md` before beginning another iteration. Create the file with this header if absent:

```markdown
# Audit trail

Append-only ledger of autonomous operations on this repo. Newest entries at the bottom.

---
```

Never rewrite, reorder, clean up, or silently correct existing entries. Append a correction when history needs amendment. The entry must let a later agent reconstruct:

- date, target, operator if known, agent identity, and outcome;
- the narrated intent and authority source;
- evidence examined and the purpose limitation found;
- `[!DECISION]` with rationale, rejected route, and relevant precedent check;
- the prediction recorded before action;
- actions and focused validation evidence, compared with the prediction;
- `[!REVERSAL]` for any route attempted and undone;
- reflection, with material learning marked `[!REALIZATION]`;
- whether durable Destination or refreshed Orientation is now needed;
- a short ranked list of next moves already visible from this iteration.

The Trail is authoritative for the agent's decision history. Derived summaries may be generated when trail size makes them earn their maintenance cost, but never replace or outrank it.

## Report

End with exactly one result line:

- `Changed <target>: <what and why>. Verification: <result>.`
- `No change to <target>: tested <quality bar> across <scope>; nothing actionable found. Verification: <result>.`
- `No change to <target>: redesign recommended because <reason>. Evidence: <result>.`
- `Stopped before changing <target>: <proposal> was not authorized. Verification: no target change.`
- `Could not complete <target>: <blocker>. Verification: <what did and did not run>.`

Detailed reasoning belongs in the append-only trail; the result line stays crisp enough to operate from.
